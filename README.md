# DubSub
This is a long-term project that aims to utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning to create a seamless visual experience. The goal is to take a re-recorded audio file as an input and generate a video file that matches up to the new audio.

The primary use case for this application is to take the audio from a dub in another language and apply it to the movie or entertainment product in question. In essence, the end result is a video where it seems like the actors were speaking in the original language, when the opposite is true. This is intended to be a learning experience for machine learning algorithms since there is already a commercial application available at [Flawless AI](https://www.flawlessai.com/product).
